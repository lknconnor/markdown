*Preperation Time: 30*

*Cook Time: 20*

*Serves 6*

**Ingredients**

* 3 medium chicken breasts, boneless, skinless, halved into 6 cutlets
* 1 1/2 cups low-fat buttermilk
* 1 Tbsp hot sauce, (we use Frank’s Red Hot brand)
* 3 tsp salt
* 2 tsp black pepper
* 2 tsp onion powder
* 2 tsp garlic powder
* 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp paprika
* Oil for frying - vegetable oil, canola oil or peanut oil
* 6 burger buns, buttered and toasted
* 6 green lettuce leaves
* 1 large tomato, sliced
* 2 dill pickles, sliced into rings
* Mayonnaise, or your favorite sauce

**Steps**

1. Pound chicken cutlets between 2 sheets of plastic wrap and pound to an even 1/2” thickness so they cook more evenly.
1. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together marinade ingredients. Add Chicken, turning to coat then cover and refrigerate for 2-4 hours or overnight.
1. In a separate shallow bowl, whisk together breading ingredients: flour, salt, pepper, baking powder, paprika, onion powder and garlic powder. Remove a piece of chicken from the marinade, letting excess drip off and dip chicken into flour mixture, pressing it on with your hands to coat well. Transfer to a wire rack.
1. Heat 1 ” oil in a soup pot or dutch oven to 350˚F. Just before frying chicken, dip it into the seasoned flour again for a thick and shaggy exterior.Add chicken, 2 pieces at a time for a smaller pot so you don’t crowd and reduce the temperature of the oil too quickly.
1. Place chicken into the oil one by one. Adjust the flame to keep the oil temperature at 300-325˚F. Cook 3-4 minutes on the first side or until browned and crisp then flip and cook another 2-3 minutes on the second side or until cooked through and chicken is browned and crisp all over.
1. Transfer to a wire rack set over a baking sheet. The internal temperature will continue to rise as it rests. The final resting temperature of the chicken should reach 165˚F.
1. Lightly butter and toast the cut sides of your buns and build your crispy chicken sandwiches with desired toppings.
